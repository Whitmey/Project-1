###Overview
Our first project was used to cement skills that we had learnt in our first 3 weeks.

###Aim
* To make a project using seperate HTML, CSS and JavaScript files
* To have a working game by deadline, hosted on Heroku
* To present my project to the rest of the group, explaining my working process 

###Process
* First I wireframed how my page would look and what I would need to display on screen
* Next I created a Trello board to plan my steps, ordered by priority
* I created my index.html file with all the elements I would need
* Next I wrote the game logic in my app.js file using JavaScript and jQuery
* After testing the game thoroughly, I styled the project using CSS3 and adding image files to my project.

###Biggest wins
* Getting the divs to move across the screen according to the random number that they had been given.
* Keeping track of the balance of the player and display how much money they had either won or lost.

###Challenges faced
* Manipulating the random numbers that were generated so that they also incorporated the odds of the horses winning, making some less likely to win than others.
* Another tough task at this stage was to stay on top of my code and to make it as streamlined as possible whilst retaining full functionality

###Steps for improvement
* CSS improvement will be necessary to improve this project.
* I could also include other betting games on the page other than racing.
